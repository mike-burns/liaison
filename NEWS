New in 0.0.4:

* Field accessors and model_name now work per-instance instead of per-class, so
  you can have more than one presenter in your system without it causing issues.

New in 0.0.3:

* Take care of a warning based on using a struct for the model_name.

New in 0.0.2:

* The #instance_validations method, part of the plumbing to make the
  validations work transparently with Rails, is protected. This would be of no
  use to you anyway, ideally.
* The Presenter class now includes the Enumerable class. This means you can
  use #map, #reject, #sort, and so on, on the Presenter data object.
