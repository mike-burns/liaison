New in 0.0.2:

* The #instance_validations method, part of the plumbing to make the
  validations work transparently with Rails, is protected. This would be of no
  use to you anyway, ideally.
* The Presenter class now includes the Enumerable class. This means you can
  use #map, #reject, #sort, and so on, on the Presenter data object.
